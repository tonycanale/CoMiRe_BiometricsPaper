A [markdown file](Tutorial.md) reproduces the analysis reported in the paper for the US Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) data on the effect of Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) on premature delivery. Those are obtained using R version 3.4.0.

The package in the folder `./CoMiRe` is not supported by the current R release. The core functions have been upgraded, modified, and wrapped into the R package CoMiRe  available on [github](https://github.com/tonycanale/CoMiRe) and on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoMiRe).
